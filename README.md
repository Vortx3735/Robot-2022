# Robot-2022
Our reworked robot code for 2022 Rapid React

note that i am very pround to say that i had little impact on this code because it is not written the way it is supposed to be (no offense to you jeremy im sorry)

fricking up is for the left climber and release for the right one instead of doing whats its named
